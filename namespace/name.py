# Practice Exercises
# Exercise 1: Local vs Global Scope Instruction:

# Define a variable with the same name in both global and local scopes within a function.
# Print the variable from inside the function and outside the function, observing how Python accesses each variable based on its scope (local vs global).
# Exercise 2: Namespace Exploration Instruction:

# Create a Python script with two functions, each defining a variable with the same name but with different purposes (e.g., count variable in a counting function and a logging function).
# Call both functions and print the variable inside each function, observing how namespaces keep variables separate within functions
# Exercise 3: Scope Hierarchy Instructions: * Define a variable in the global scope, then create a function with an enclosing scope that redefines a variable with the same name. * Inside this function, access both the global and enclosing variables and print their values. * Discuss with comments in the code how Python follows the LEGB rule for variable lookup.
